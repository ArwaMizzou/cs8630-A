    "# Analyzing Campaign Contributions from 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will work with a cleaned Donald Trump contributions CSV file. We will ask questions whose results we might use in a story, graphic or interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file we will be working with is found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "./trump_contribs.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about the data fields can be found at the Federal Elections Commission Contributions by individuals file description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually it is good to ask big picture questions that we can as a benchmark. The table has only one numeric field, amount, so we will be limited somewhat.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let’s answer these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many total records of contributions?\n",
    "* How much was given in total?\n",
    "* How much was given on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our file has contributions from two committees:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: You do not need to download these. They contain current and historical data. We are only looking at 2016.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first is [Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.](http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00580100), his campaign committee. (Filer_id: C00580100) \n",
    "* The second is [Great America PAC](http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00608489), a Super PAC that supported Trump in the 2016 election. (Filer_id: C00608489)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the same analysis for each, so we can see how they compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump’s campaign has said he’s won widespread support from donors who are willing to give him small contributions. According to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-supporters-eager-to-drain-the-swamp-help-fill-gop-coffers/2017/10/05/ec214f22-a53d-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.2fb48b4a5b50) in 2017, he beat Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the number of people contributing $200 or less.  Let’s check that out now with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate the counts overall and separately for the two committees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be interesting to see how the contributions flow in from month to month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you are going to look at how Trump did with contributions in states he won, but had voted for Barack Obama in 2012:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Florida\n",
    "* Iowa\n",
    "* Michigan\n",
    "* Ohio\n",
    "* Pennsylvania\n",
    "\n",
    "How did he do in those states compared to the rest of the United States, overall and month by month?\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump is often on the road at campaign rallies. Can you find any dates and locations that have a higher than usual number of contributions that came in for him? That could hint at a fundraising event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's look at contributions of $250 and under both nationally in the flipped states to test the statement that Trump had a great deal of support from small donors.\n"
